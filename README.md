Nishang

Nishang is a framework and collection of scripts and payloads which enables usage of PowerShell for offensive security and post exploitation during Penetraion Tests. The scripts are written on the basis of requirement by the author during real Penetration Tests.

It contains many interesting scripts like Keylogger, DNS TXT Code Execution, HTTP Backdoor, Powerpreter, LSA Secrets and much more.

To get help about any script or payload, use
